# Super Arp Module for Schwung

Advanced MIDI arpeggiator module for Ableton Move, built for Schwung.

## Features

Super Arp is a chainable MIDI FX module (`midi_fx`) for Schwung. It turns held notes into deterministic or randomized arpeggiated phrases, with independent control over timing, note order, rhythm, and variation.

- Internal clock or external MIDI clock sync
- Rate, triplet, swing, gate, velocity override, and latch controls
- Max voices with oldest-first voice stealing
- Deterministic octave range modes (`0`, `+1`, `-1`, `+2`, `-2`)
- Progression modes including pattern and random pattern
- 40 progression presets with chord-step notation support
- 40 rhythm presets with trigger/rest notation
- Per-engine trigger behavior (`retrigger` / `continuous`)
- Seeded modifier engine (drop, velocity, gate, octave, and note randomization)
- Optional modifier loop length for repeating deterministic modulation

## Prerequisites

- [Schwung](https://github.com/charlesvestal/move-anything) installed on your Ableton Move
- SSH access enabled: http://move.local/development/ssh

## Installation

### Via Module Store

If Super Arp is published in Module Store:

1. Launch Schwung on your Move
2. Select **Module Store**
3. Navigate to **MIDI FX** -> **Super Arp**
4. Select **Install**

### Manual Installation

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

## Usage

Super Arp is a MIDI FX module:

1. Insert **Super Arp** in a chain's MIDI FX slot
2. Feed MIDI notes/chords into the chain
3. Route output to a synth/sampler module
4. Shape timing, progression, rhythm, and modifiers in Shadow UI

## Parameters

In Shadow UI, parameters are organized into categories.

### Global

Global controls define transport/timing behavior and base output characteristics for every generated note.

| Parameter | What it does |
|---------|--------|
| `latch` | Holds notes after release when enabled. |
| `max_voices` | Limits simultaneous output voices (`1-64`), stealing oldest first. |
| `rate` | Sets arp step division (`1/32`, `1/16`, `1/8`, `1/4`). |
| `triplet` | Enables triplet timing for step duration. |
| `swing` | Applies swing amount (`0-100`) to internal timing. |
| `gate` | Sets note length (`0-1600`), including overlaps beyond one step. |
| `velocity` | Base velocity override (`0` = as played, `1-127` = fixed base). |
| `octave_range` | Applies deterministic octave movement (`0`, `+1`, `-1`, `+2`, `-2`). |
| `sync` | Chooses timing source (`internal` or incoming MIDI `clock`). |
| `bpm` | Internal tempo (`40-240`) when `sync=internal`. |

### Progression

Progression controls decide which held notes are selected on each trigger step, including ordered, patterned, and seeded random behavior.

Pattern notation for progression presets:
- Numbers (`1`, `2`, `3`, ...) reference held notes sorted by pitch (lowest to highest).
- `-` separates time steps.
- Parentheses group simultaneous notes into a chord step, for example `(1-3)`.

| Parameter | What it does |
|---------|--------|
| `progression_mode` (`mode`) | Selects note order engine: `up`, `down`, `as_played`, `leap_inward`, `leap_outward`, `chord`, `pattern`, `random_pattern`. |
| `pattern_preset` (`pattern`) | Selects one of 40 progression presets for `pattern` mode. |
| `progression_trigger` (`trigger`) | Sets reset policy: `retrigger` or `continuous`. |
| `missing_note_policy` (`note policy`) | Handles out-of-range pattern indices: `fold`, `wrap`, `clamp`, `skip`. |
| `progression_seed` (`rand seed`) | Main seed for random progression generation. |
| `random_pattern_length` (`rand length`) | Sets random pattern length (`1-32`). For `random_pattern` mode only. |
| `random_pattern_chords` (`rand chords`) | Increases chord density in random pattern (`0-100`). For `random_pattern` mode only. |
| `random_pattern_chord_seed` (`rand ch seed`) | Additional seed used for random chord voicing choices. For `random_pattern` mode only. |

### Rhythm

Rhythm controls define trigger/rest pulses that gate progression advancement.

Pattern notation for rhythm presets:
- `0` means trigger/play a step.
- `x` means rest/pause (no trigger on that step).
- Each character is one step in sequence order from left to right.

| Parameter | What it does |
|---------|--------|
| `rhythm_preset` (`pattern`) | Selects one of 40 rhythm strings (`0` = trigger, `x` = rest). |
| `rhythm_trigger` (`trigger`) | Sets rhythm reset policy: `retrigger` or `continuous`. |

### Modifiers

Modifiers add deterministic variation on top of selected notes. Each modifier has independent seeded behavior, and all can follow a shared loop length.

| Parameter | What it does |
|---------|--------|
| `modifier_loop_length` (`mod loop`) | Loop length for modifier randomness (`0-128`, `0` = no loop). |
| `modifier_trigger` (`trigger`) | Sets modifier loop reset policy: `retrigger` or `continuous`. |
| `drop_amount` (`drop`) | Probability-like amount to skip triggered steps (`0-100`). |
| `drop_seed` | Seed for drop decisions. |
| `velocity_random_amount` (`vel rand`) | Randomizes outgoing velocity (`0-127`). |
| `velocity_seed` (`vel seed`) | Seed for velocity randomization. |
| `gate_random_amount` (`gate rand`) | Randomizes gate length (`0-1600`). |
| `gate_seed` | Seed for gate randomization. |
| `random_octave_amount` (`oct rand`) | Amount of octave randomization (`0-100`). |
| `random_octave_range` (`oct range`) | Octave randomization set: `+1`, `-1`, `+-1`, `+2`, `-2`, `+-2`. |
| `random_octave_seed` (`oct seed`) | Seed for octave randomization. |
| `random_note_amount` (`note rand`) | Replaces selected notes with other held notes (`0-100`). |
| `random_note_seed` (`note seed`) | Seed for note replacement decisions. |

## Troubleshooting

**No arpeggio output:**
- Verify notes are reaching Super Arp (check chain MIDI routing)
- Check rhythm pattern is not resting (`x`) at the current step
- In `clock` sync mode, ensure external MIDI clock start/tick is present

**Too many overlapping notes:**
- Lower `gate`
- Lower `max_voices`

**Timing sounds wrong:**
- Verify `sync` mode matches your setup (`internal` vs `clock`)
- Check `triplet` and `swing` settings

**Need debug logs:**
- This build writes debug logs to `/data/UserData/schwung/superarp.log`

## Building from Source

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
